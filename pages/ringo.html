        <!-- BASIC INFO -->
        <div class="m-5 pb-4 infoContainer">
            <p>Starr occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including "Yellow Submarine"
                and "With a Little Help from My Friends". He also wrote and sang the Beatles songs "Don't Pass Me By" and
                "Octopus's Garden", and is credited as a co-writer of four others.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the Beatles' films, Starr has acted in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he
                released several successful singles including the US top-ten hit "It Don't Come Easy", and number ones "Photograph"
                and "You're Sixteen". His most successful UK single was "Back Off Boogaloo", which peaked at number two.
                He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both
                the UK and the US. Starr has featured in numerous documentaries, hosted television shows, narrated the first
                two series of the children's television program Thomas & Friends and portrayed "Mr. Conductor" during the
                first season of the PBS children's television series Shining Time Station. Since 1989, he has toured with
                thirteen variations of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.
            </p>
            <p>Starr's playing style, which emphasised feel over technical virtuosity, influenced many drummers to reconsider
                their playing from a compositional perspective. He also influenced various modern drumming techniques, such
                as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings.[4] In his opinion,
                his finest recorded performance was on the Beatles' "Rain".[5] In 1999, he was inducted into the Modern Drummer
                Hall of Fame.[6] In 2011, Rolling Stone readers named him the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. He was
                inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a Beatle in 1988 and as a solo artist in 2015,[7]
                and appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music.[8] In 2020, he was cited
                as the wealthiest drummer in the world, with a net worth of $350 million.
