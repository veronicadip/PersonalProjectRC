        <!-- BASIC INFO -->
        <div class="m-5 pb-4 infoContainer">
            <p>Starr occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including "Yellow Submarine"
                and "With a Little Help from My Friends". He also wrote and sang the Beatles songs "Don't Pass Me By" and
                "Octopus's Garden", and is credited as a co-writer of four others.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the Beatles' films, Starr has acted in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he
                released several successful singles including the US top-ten hit "It Don't Come Easy", and number ones "Photograph"
                and "You're Sixteen". His most successful UK single was "Back Off Boogaloo", which peaked at number two.
                He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both
                the UK and the US. Starr has featured in numerous documentaries, hosted television shows, narrated the first
                two series of the children's television program Thomas & Friends and portrayed "Mr. Conductor" during the
                first season of the PBS children's television series Shining Time Station. Since 1989, he has toured with
                thirteen variations of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.
            </p>
            <p>Starr's playing style, which emphasised feel over technical virtuosity, influenced many drummers to reconsider
                their playing from a compositional perspective. He also influenced various modern drumming techniques, such
                as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings.[4] In his opinion,
                his finest recorded performance was on the Beatles' "Rain".[5] In 1999, he was inducted into the Modern Drummer
                Hall of Fame.[6] In 2011, Rolling Stone readers named him the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. He was
                inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a Beatle in 1988 and as a solo artist in 2015,[7]
                and appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music.[8] In 2020, he was cited
                as the wealthiest drummer in the world, with a net worth of $350 million.

            <img src="../assets/ringo/career1.jpeg" alt="Ringo Starr when he was a kid" class="sidePhotoRight ms-5 mb-2 rounded">
            <p>Richard Starkey was born on 7 July 1940 at 9 Madryn Street in Dingle, an inner-city area of Liverpool. He is
                the only child of confectioners Richard Starkey (1913–1981) and Elsie Gleave (1914–1987).[10] Elsie enjoyed
                singing and dancing, a hobby that she shared with her husband, an avid fan of swing.[11] Prior to the birth
                of their son, whom they called "Richy", the couple had spent much of their free time on the local ballroom
                circuit, but their regular outings ended soon after his birth.[12] Elsie adopted an overprotective approach
                to raising her son that bordered on fixation. Subsequently, "Big Ritchie", as Starkey's father became known,
                lost interest in his family, choosing instead to spend long hours drinking and dancing in pubs, sometimes
                for several consecutive days.</p>
            <p>n an effort to reduce their housing costs, his family moved in 1944 to another neighbourhood in the Dingle, Admiral
                Grove; soon afterwards his parents separated, and they divorced within the year.[13] Starkey later stated
                that he has "no real memories" of his father, who made little effort to bond with him, visiting as few as
                three times thereafter.[14] Elsie found it difficult to survive on her ex-husband's support payments of thirty
                shillings a week, so she took on several menial jobs cleaning houses before securing a position as a barmaid,
                an occupation that she held for twelve years.</p>
            <p>At the age of six, Starkey developed appendicitis. Following a routine appendectomy he contracted peritonitis,
                causing him to fall into a coma that lasted days.[16] His recovery spanned twelve months, which he spent
                away from his family at Liverpool's Myrtle Street children's hospital.[17] Upon his discharge in May 1948,
                his mother allowed him to stay at home, causing him to miss school.[18] At age eight, he remained illiterate,
                with a poor grasp of mathematics.[18] His lack of education contributed to a feeling of alienation at school,
                which resulted in his regularly playing truant at Sefton Park.[19] After several years of twice-weekly tutoring
                from his surrogate sister and neighbour, Marie Maguire Crawford, Starkey had nearly caught up to his peers
                academically, but in 1953, he contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium, where he remained
                for two years.[20] During his stay the medical staff made an effort to stimulate motor activity and relieve
                boredom by encouraging their patients to join the hospital band, leading to his first exposure to a percussion
                instrument: a makeshift mallet made from a cotton bobbin that he used to strike the cabinets next to his
                bed.[21] Soon afterwards, he grew increasingly interested in drumming, receiving a copy of the Alyn Ainsworth
                song "Bedtime for Drums" as a convalescence gift from Crawford.[22] Starkey commented: "I was in the hospital
                band ... That's where I really started playing. I never wanted anything else from there on ... My grandparents
                gave me a mandolin and a banjo, but I didn't want them. My grandfather gave me a harmonica ... we had a piano
                – nothing. Only the drums.</p>
            <p>Starkey attended St Silas, a Church of England primary school near his house where his classmates nicknamed him
                "Lazarus", and later Dingle Vale Secondary modern school, where he showed an aptitude for art and drama,
                as well as practical subjects including mechanics.[24] As a result of the prolonged hospitalisations, he
                fell behind his peers scholastically and was ineligible for the 11-plus qualifying examination required for
                attendance at a grammar school.[25] On 17 April 1954, Starkey's mother married Harry Graves at the register
                office on Mount Pleasant, Liverpool.[26] He was an ex-Londoner who had moved to Liverpool following the failure
                of his first marriage. Graves, an impassioned fan of big band music and their vocalists, introduced Starkey
                to recordings by Dinah Shore, Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels.[27] Graves stated that he and "Ritchie" never
                had an unpleasant exchange between them; Starkey later commented: "He was great ... I learned gentleness
                from Harry."[28] After the extended hospital stay following Starkey's recovery from tuberculosis, he did
                not return to school, preferring instead to stay at home and listen to music while playing along by beating
                biscuit tins with sticks.</p>
            <p>After his return home from the sanatorium in late 1955, Starkey entered the workforce but was lacking in motivation
                and discipline; his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful.[33] In an effort to secure
                himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a railway worker's job with British Rail, which came with an employer-issued
                suit. He was supplied with a hat but no uniform and, unable to pass the physical examination, he was laid
                off and granted unemployment benefits.[34] He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that
                travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but his fear of conscription into military service led him to quit
                the job, not wanting to give the Royal Navy the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work.[35] In
                mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice machinist at Henry Hunt and Son, a Liverpool
                school equipment manufacturer.[36] While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the
                two bonded over their shared interest in music.[37] Trafford introduced Starkey to skiffle, and he quickly
                became a fervent admirer.</p>
