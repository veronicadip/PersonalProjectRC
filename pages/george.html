        <!-- BASIC INFO -->
        <div class="m-5 pb-4 infoContainer">
            <p>Sometimes called "the quiet Beatle", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular
                music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles'
                work.[2] Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles
                albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group include "Taxman",
                "Within You Without You", "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something". Harrison's
                earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; subsequent influences were Carl
                Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry.
            </p>
            <p>By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and
                towards Indian classical music through his use of Indian instruments, such as the sitar, which he had become
                acquainted with on the set of the film Help![3] He played sitar on numerous Beatles songs, starting with
                "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)". Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation
                in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up
                in 1970, Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass, a critically acclaimed work that produced
                his most successful hit single, "My Sweet Lord", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the
                slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor
                to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts
                signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974; he co-founded HandMade
                Films in 1978, initially to produce the Monty Python troupe's comedy film The Life of Brian (1979).
            </p>
            <p>Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling
                supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks
                by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton,
                Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the
                "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time". He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee – as a member
                of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.
            </p>
            <p>Harrison's first marriage, to model Pattie Boyd in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. In the following year he married
                Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two
                years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his home, Friar Park. His remains were cremated, and
                the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers
                in India. He left an estate of almost £100 million.

            <img src="../assets/george/career1.webp" alt="George Harrison when he was a kid" class="sidePhotoRight ms-5 mb-2 rounded">
            <p>Harrison was born at 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree, Liverpool, on 25 February 1943.[5][nb 2] He was the youngest
                of four children of Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison (1909–1978) and Louise (née French;[10] 1911–1970).
                Harold was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship's steward on the White Star Line,[11] and Louise was
                a shop assistant of Irish Catholic descent.[6] He had one sister, Louise (16 August 1931 – 29 January 2023),
                and two brothers, Harold (born 1934) and Peter (20 July 1940 – 1 June 2007).</p>
            <p>According to Boyd, Harrison's mother was particularly supportive: "All she wanted for her children is that they
                should be happy, and she recognised that nothing made George quite as happy as making music."[14] Louise
                was an enthusiastic music fan, and she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times
                startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons' windows.[15] When Louise was pregnant with George, she often
                listened to the weekly broadcast Radio India. Harrison's biographer Joshua Greene wrote, "Every Sunday she
                tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and
                calm to the baby in the womb.</p>
            <p>For the first four years of his life, Harrison lived at 12 Arnold Grove, a terraced house on a cul-de-sac.[17]
                The home had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire. In 1949, the family was offered
                a council house and moved to 25 Upton Green, Speke.[18] In 1948, at the age of five, Harrison enrolled at
                Dovedale Primary School.[19] He passed the eleven-plus exam and attended Liverpool Institute High School
                for Boys from 1954 to 1959.[20][21] Though the institute did offer a music course, Harrison was disappointed
                with the absence of guitars, and felt the school "moulded [students] into being frightened".</p>
            <p>MHarrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby, Cab Calloway, Django Reinhardt and Hoagy Carmichael;[23]
                by the 1950s, Carl Perkins and Lonnie Donegan were significant influences.[24] In early 1956, he had an epiphany:
                while riding his bicycle, he heard Elvis Presley's "Heartbreak Hotel" playing from a nearby house, and the
                song piqued his interest in rock and roll.[25] He often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in his
                schoolbooks, and later commented, "I was totally into guitars."[26] Harrison cited Slim Whitman as another
                early influence: "The first person I ever saw playing a guitar was Slim Whitman, either a photo of him in
                a magazine or live on television. Guitars were definitely coming in.</p>
            <p>At first, Harold Harrison was apprehensive about his son's interest in pursuing a music career. However, in 1956,
                he bought George a Dutch Egmond flat-top acoustic guitar, which according to Harold, cost £3.10s.– (equivalent
                to £90 in 2023[28]).[29][30] One of his father's friends taught Harrison how to play "Whispering", "Sweet
                Sue" and "Dinah". Inspired by Donegan's music, Harrison formed a skiffle group, the Rebels, with his brother
                Peter and a friend, Arthur Kelly.[31] On the bus to school, Harrison met Paul McCartney, who also attended
                the Liverpool Institute, and the pair bonded over their shared love of music.</p>
