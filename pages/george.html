        <!-- BASIC INFO -->
        <div class="m-5 pb-4 infoContainer">
            <p>Sometimes called "the quiet Beatle", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular
                music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles'
                work.[2] Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles
                albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group include "Taxman",
                "Within You Without You", "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something". Harrison's
                earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; subsequent influences were Carl
                Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry.
            </p>
            <p>By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and
                towards Indian classical music through his use of Indian instruments, such as the sitar, which he had become
                acquainted with on the set of the film Help![3] He played sitar on numerous Beatles songs, starting with
                "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)". Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation
                in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up
                in 1970, Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass, a critically acclaimed work that produced
                his most successful hit single, "My Sweet Lord", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the
                slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor
                to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts
                signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974; he co-founded HandMade
                Films in 1978, initially to produce the Monty Python troupe's comedy film The Life of Brian (1979).
            </p>
            <p>Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling
                supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks
                by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton,
                Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the
                "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time". He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee – as a member
                of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.
            </p>
            <p>Harrison's first marriage, to model Pattie Boyd in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. In the following year he married
                Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two
                years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his home, Friar Park. His remains were cremated, and
                the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers
                in India. He left an estate of almost £100 million.
