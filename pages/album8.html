        <div class="mx-3 pt-3">
            <p class="mx-5 mt-5 albumInfo">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. Released
                on 26 May 1967,[nb 1] Sgt. Pepper is regarded by musicologists as an early concept album that advanced the
                roles of sound composition, extended form, psychedelic imagery, record sleeves, and the producer in popular
                music. The album had an immediate cross-generational impact and was associated with numerous touchstones
                of the era's youth culture, such as fashion, drugs, mysticism, and a sense of optimism and empowerment. Critics
                lauded the album for its innovations in songwriting, production and graphic design, for bridging a cultural
                divide between popular music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the
                counterculture.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="mx-5 albumInfo">At the end of August 1966, the Beatles had permanently retired from touring and pursued individual interests
                for the next three months. During a return flight to London in November, Paul McCartney had an idea for a
                song involving an Edwardian military band that formed the impetus of the Sgt. Pepper concept. For this project,
                they continued the technological experimentation marked by their previous album, Revolver, this time without
                an absolute deadline for completion. Sessions began on 24 November at EMI Studios with compositions inspired
                by the Beatles' youth, but after pressure from EMI, the songs "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane"
                were released as a double A-side single in February 1967 and left off the LP. The album was then loosely
                conceptualised as a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band, an idea that was conceived after recording
                the title track.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="mx-5 albumInfo">A key work of British psychedelia, Sgt. Pepper is considered one of the first art rock LPs and a progenitor to
                progressive rock. It incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including vaudeville, circus, music hall,
                avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. With assistance from producer George Martin and engineer
                Geoff Emerick, much of the recordings were coloured with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified
                on "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" and "A Day in the Life". Recording
                was completed on 21 April. The cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a tableau of celebrities
                and historical figures, was designed by the pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="mx-5 albumInfo">Sgt. Pepper's release was a defining moment in pop culture, heralding the album era and the 1967 Summer of Love,
                while its reception achieved full cultural legitimisation for pop music and recognition for the medium as
                a genuine art form. The first Beatles album to be released with the same track listing in both the UK and
                the US, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the Record Retailer chart in the United Kingdom and 15 weeks at
                number one on the Billboard Top LPs chart in the United States. In 1968, it won four Grammy Awards, including
                Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honour; in 2003, it was inducted into the National Recording
                Registry by the Library of Congress. It has topped several critics' and listeners' polls for the best album
                of all time, including those published by Rolling Stone magazine and in the book All Time Top 1000 Albums,
                and the UK's "Music of the Millennium" poll. More than 32 million copies had been sold worldwide as of 2011.
                It remains one of the best-selling albums of all time and was still, in 2018, the UK's best-selling studio
                album. A remixed and expanded edition of the album was released in 2017.
